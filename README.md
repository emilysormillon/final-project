## **Data**
The data used for this analysis was a numerous of songs written by Taylor Swift, gathered from many of her albums. What was being analyzed was the popularity and the intensity of the song through how relatable a song is, the emotions a song shows (tone), the number of listeners each song has, and how many beats per minute a song contains. Each unit of analysis was one song and there were 45 observations collected. The type of sampling strategy that was used was convenience sampling. 

I gathered the data by going through Taylor Swift's albums and analyzed the title and lyrics to determine whether it felt relatable or not. To find the narrative tone, I analyzed the song by listening to her voice while singing to gauge how she felt. I checked Spotify for the amount of listeners that each song had and for the intensity, I searched up how many beats per minute each song had. 

## **Operationalization**
The concept of tone and emotional quality of the song was operationalized through a qualitative coding scheme from 1-5. 1 described any depressing songs, 2 described any sad songs, 3 described any angry songs, 4 described any happy songs, and 5 described any ecstatic songs. For this variable, the tone of Swift's voice, the rhythm and melody of the song were taken into account when operationalized.

The concept of relatability of a song was operationalized through a qualitative coding scheme from 1-4. 1 indicated that the song is not relatable at all, 2 indicated that the song was somewhat relatable, 3 indicated that the song was relatable, and 4 indicated that the song was extremely relatable. For this variable, the lyrics and emotions of the song were taken into account when operationalized. 

The concept of popularity of a song was operationalized through a quantitative variable named listners per song and was measured on a scale from 0 - 1,300,000,000. The fewer number of listeners fell lower on the scale and vice versa. The amount of listeners was collected through the music platform Spotify. 

The concept of energy of a song was operationalized through a quantitative variable named intensity where the songs were measured on a bpm scale from 0 - 204. A slower song would fall lower on the scale as a faster song would fall higher on the scale. To measure this concept, the bpm was calculated by a metronome and collected from an online website.
